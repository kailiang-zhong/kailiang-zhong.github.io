#一些故事｜ Some history
- 关于我是如何入门机器学习：在2013年的时候，忘记了什么缘由，我接触到了 [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) 并且学习了台湾大学[林轩田教授](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/htlin)的两门课程[《机器学习基石》](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/htlin)、[《机器学习技法》](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-techniques)。当时我大三，这两门课程对于当时的我来说还是有点困难的，庆幸的是，有个叫 Beader 的网友，也在学习这两门课， [Beader](https://beader.me)鼓励着我并且时常与我讨论课堂知识和作业，让我跟上了课程并且完成作业拿到了结业证书。Beader当时在台湾读研究生，我们上完课后参加了Kaggle的PAKDD比赛(取得了top5%) 以及**2014年阿里巴巴第一届天池大数据竞赛**，后来获得什么名次忘记了（好像是78？总共七千多支队伍），只记得当时我们队有三个人，另一个是他的女同学。后来，他们在一起了，再后来，她们结婚了：）

- 2015年 参加了第二届阿里天池大数据竞赛--阿里移动推荐算法，队名Wonder，排名 37/7186 。

- 2019年去了新疆环天山山脉自驾，在安集海大峡谷看过如水彩画般的河谷，在独库公路一日看过四季，风景很美，我以后还会再去新疆。

- 2020年春节前夕，我打电话跟我妈说过年想出去旅游不回家了，原本以为她会规训我一顿，没想到她说：刚好，我也想出去走走呢。 于是，2020年的春节，我决定带爸妈去了新加坡-马来西亚旅游过年。出发当天，正是疫情爆发前夕，飞机刚在新加坡落地，就得知消息，国内新冠疫情爆发了，我们如果晚出半天就出不来了。这次旅行创造了很多美好回忆，我第一次在国外过年，我爸妈也是。我们在马六甲度过了那年的年除夕夜。

- 2020年十一国庆节，我去过了四川自驾，走了川西大环线，因为新冠原因色达佛教寺不开放，就从炉霍县走中国熊猫大道南下直接去稻城亚丁。318进，317出，看见了无数路基坍塌、山体滑坡、落石，在熊猫大道走过危桥，去理塘的路上走过了天路十八弯。在去稻城的路上，赶夜路，在中途一段山路停留休息时，我看到了以往从未见过的清澈夜空，感觉自己同时被夜和银河包围了，如果只看天上，甚至会有种置身于宇宙的错觉。事后我查过才知道，那是一个光污染为0的地方。我永远不会忘记那样的清澈夜空。旅程的最远点是稻城亚丁，第一次听说这个地方是张嘉佳同名小说改编的电影《从你的全世界路过》，那真是一个童话般的世界，伴随山间清爽的风，穿过有牛马嬉耍的草甸，远处有雪山，融化的冰水借道小溪、浅谈灌溉一切。在稻城亚迪里，感觉一切的生灵都是幸福的。

- How I got started with machine learning: In 2013, I forgot why, I came across Coursera and took two courses by Professor Lin Hsuan-Tien from National Taiwan University: "Machine Learning Foundations" and "Machine Learning Techniques". At that time, I was a junior in college and found these courses challenging. Fortunately, there was a friend I met on the internet named Beader who was also taking these courses. Beader encouraged me and often discussed class knowledge and assignments with me, which helped me keep up with the courses and complete the homework to earn a certificate of completion. Beader was a graduate student 
and was pursuing a master's degree in Taiwan at the time. After we finished the courses, we participated in the PAKDD competition on Kaggle and Alibaba's first Tianchi Big Data Competition in 2014. I don't remember what place we got, but I do remember that our team had three people, including Beader's female classmate who later became his girlfriend and then his wife haha :-)

- In 2019, I went on a self-driving trip to the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang. I saw a river valley that looked like a watercolor painting in the Anjihai Grand Canyon and experienced all four seasons in one day on the Karakoram Highway. The scenery was so beautiful, and I plan to visit Xinjiang again in the future.

- On the eve of the 2020 Spring Festival, I called my mom and told her that I wanted to travel instead of going home for the New Year. I thought she would scold me, but to my surprise, she said, "Great, I also want to go out and see the world." So, during the 2020 Spring Festival, I decided to take my parents on a trip to Singapore and Malaysia to celebrate the New Year. On the day of departure, just as we landed in Singapore, we received news that the COVID-19 outbreak had started in China. If we had left half a day later, we would have been stuck there. This trip created many wonderful memories. It was my first time celebrating the New Year abroad, as well as for my parents. We spent New Year's Eve in the famous city of Malacca.

- During the 2020 National Day holiday, I went on a self-driving trip to Sichuan Province(四川省), China and took the West Sichuan Ring Road. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Seda Wuming Buddhist Academy（色达五明佛学院） was closed, so I took the China Panda Avenue from Luhuo County(炉霍县) to the south and went directly to Daocheng Yading. On the way, I encountered countless roadbed collapses, mountain landslides, and falling rocks while Entering from National Road 318 and exiting from National Road 317. I crossed a dangerous bridge on Panda Avenue and took the 18th turn of mountain road on the way to Litang(理塘). On the way to Daocheng(稻城), I caught the night road and stopped on a mountain road midway to rest. There, I saw a clear night sky that I had never seen before, feeling surrounded by both night and the Milky Way. If I only looked at the sky, I would even have the illusion of being in the universe! Afterwards, I checked and found out that it was a place with zero light pollution. I will never forget the clear night sky like that. The farthest point of the journey is Daocheng　Yading(稻城亚丁). I first heard that this place is the movie "Passing Through Your World" adapted from Zhang Jiajia's novel of the same name. It is truly a fairytale like world, accompanied by the refreshing wind in the mountains, passing through meadows with cattle and horses playing, and in the distance, there are snowy mountains. Melting ice water borrows through small streams to irrigate everything. In Daocheng　Yading, it feels like all living beings are happy.
